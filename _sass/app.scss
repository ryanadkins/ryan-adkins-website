* Project Website: www.ryanadkins.com
* You can read more about this project at www.ryanadkins.com/about/website.html
*
* -----------Helpful Tips------------------
* Naming Convention: Use Class for CSS and Id for JS
* Try not to nest more than 1 deep (LESS/SASS)
* Don"t use !important in Base or Layout css (if needed refactor code)
* Avoid jQuery methods that inlines CSS
* Don"t code CSS for the page. Code it for the system
* Use simple selectors (ie. single selector or one child selector) Google Page Speed Best Practice
* Encapuslation: 
*   Code should do one thing and one thing only
*   Media queries should be included with modules
*   Should testable with no extra dependencies on other modules
