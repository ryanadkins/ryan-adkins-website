The process of setting up Netlify CMS with the starter Jekyll Netlify CMS has been a fairly easy process. I believe that from the time it took to clone the template to starting to writing my first post took about an hour give or take. I will be migrating my personal website to Netlify from gitHub pages over the next few weeks.
